Hello, world. My first ever technical blog post. However, I must confess. There will be nothing technical in these words, at all. This is a post to simply set the tone. I still feel as if I am so new to the world of programming that I do not have anything worth to say as of yet, but here I am anyway.

You may be wondering at this point why I am writing anything at all.

* **Reason 1: To reiterate and integrate.**
I'm sure this is not new to many of you, but the process of carefully organising information requires a decent level of familiarity with the topic. In writing these posts I hope to clarify my own understanding.

* **Reason 2: To build a public record.**
I think it will be nice to see in future that I've made some progress. It might also be incredibly useful to look back and remember exactly how I thought about a problem before I knew the 'right' way.

* **Reason 3: To connect with others.**
On the off chance someone finds something of interest in all this, it may lead to a friend. If you're learning too, maybe we can figure it out together!

So what's next? I'm not entirely sure. I'm currently deep in the trenches of the [Open Container Initiative](https://opencontainers.org/) in an attempt to write my own container software, so chances are high that my frustration with that will be the subject of Post #2.

Onwards.

    <h3>Why I'm Writing a Blog as a Total Beginner</h2>

<p><time datetime="2025-12-15 00:00:00">Monday, 15th December, 2025</time></p>
<p>Hello, world. My first ever technical blog post. However, I must confess. There will be nothing technical in these words, at all. This is a post to simply set the tone. I still feel as if I am so new to the world of programming that I do not have anything worth to say as of yet, but here I am anyway.</p>
<p>You may be wondering at this point why I am writing anything at all.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Reason 1: To reiterate and integrate.</strong>
I'm sure this is not new to many of you, but the process of carefully organising information requires a decent level of familiarity with the topic. In writing these posts I hope to clarify my own understanding.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Reason 2: To build a public record.</strong>
I think it will be nice to see in future that I've made some progress. It might also be incredibly useful to look back and remember exactly how I thought about a problem before I knew the 'right' way.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Reason 3: To connect with others.</strong>
On the off chance someone finds something of interest in all this, it may lead to a friend. If you're learning too, maybe we can figure it out together!</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>So what's next? I'm not entirely sure. I'm currently deep in the trenches of the <a href="https://opencontainers.org/">Open Container Initiative</a> in an attempt to write my own container software, so chances are high that my frustration with that will be the subject of Post #2.</p>
<p>Onwards.</p>

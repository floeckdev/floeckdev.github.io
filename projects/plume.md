This is something I have wanted to do for a while. Ever since I heard of docker and played around with it I was fascinated by the fact that you could run an app/service on consistent environments. It was clearly a special time for programmers as being able to write apps and not worry as much about their execution environment is a huge win.

My initial research into this topic led me to the [Open Container Initiative]("https://opencontainers.org/"), which are standards for people looking to develop their own container software.

At its core, containers essentially are a wrapper for a variety of namespaces.

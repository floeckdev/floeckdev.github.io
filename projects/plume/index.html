<p>This is something I have wanted to do for a while. Ever since I heard of docker and played around with it I was fascinated by the fact that you could run an app/service on consistent environments. It was clearly a special time for programmers as being able to write apps and not worry as much about their execution environment is a huge win.</p>
<p>My initial research into this topic led me to the <a href="" title="https://opencontainers.org/">Open Container Initiative</a>, which are standards for people looking to develop their own container software.</p>
<p>At its core, containers essentially are a wrapper for a variety of namespaces.</p>
